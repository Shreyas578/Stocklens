# Stocklens 📈

**Stocklens** is a real-time stock market dashboard that streams Indian stock market indices (like Nifty 50, Bank Nifty, Fin Nifty, and Sensex) along with live updates and graphs.  
It uses **Fluvio** for streaming backend data and a **simple web frontend** to visualize market movements.

Would you also like me to generate a ready-to-use **fixed project** (where I rename `pakage.json` properly and make a starter `package.json`)?  
It'll make the project ready to run immediately 🚀.
